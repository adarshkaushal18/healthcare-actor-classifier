Another earnings season, another set of reports from the leading players in the market. There were some winners and losers in the last quarter. 

This week's highlights are the following:

1️⃣ Bristol Myers Squibb's earnings surge and guidance raise: Reported adjusted EPS of $1.80 versus $1.49 expected; revenue of $11.89 billion surpasses estimates, driven by Eliquis and growth portfolio #drugs like Reblozyl and Opdivo. The company raised its full-year revenue guidance, expecting sales to increase by around 5%.

2️⃣ Merck's Keytruda drives Q3 performance: Adjusted EPS of $1.57 beats expectations; revenue reaches $16.66 billion. #Keytruda sales increased 17% to $7.43 billion, offsetting an 11% decline in Gardasil sales due to lower demand in China.

3️⃣ Pfizer's revenue surges amid #Covid product demand: Adjusted EPS of $1.06 surpasses estimates; revenue of $17.7 billion beats forecasts. #Paxlovid and Covid vaccine sales boosted earnings, but the company faces activist investor pressure to improve capital deployment.

4️⃣ Eli Lilly's shares dropped despite solid #demand. The company Missed Q3 earnings estimates due to inventory adjustments, and Zepbound and Mounjaro sales fell short despite a 25% increase in prescriptions. Therefore, the company lowered its full-year adjusted profit guidance.

5️⃣ Biogen raises profit guidance on Leqembi #sales: Adjusted EPS of $4.08 beat expectations, and revenue of $2.47 billion exceeded estimates. The Alzheimer's drug Leqembi generated $67 million in sales, exceeding projections and helping offset declines in multiple sclerosis products.

6️⃣ Smith & Nephew cuts #forecast amid China demand slump: Shares fell 12% after lowering its revenue growth forecast due to unexpectedly weak demand in China, impacted by the country's volume-based procurement program affecting #medicaldevices.

7️⃣ Teva fined €463 million by EU for #Antitrust Violations: The European Commission fined Teva for unfairly disparaging a rival multiple sclerosis drug and manipulating patent protections for its product, Copaxone.","['Healthcare Provider', 'Pharmaceutical Representative', 'Regulator']"

The pharmacy model needs to evolve to match that transformation.

---

CVS Health recently released their fall ""Rx Report"" looking at the trends in community pharmacy.

""Based on a survey of #pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and consumers, the annual Rx Report analyzes industry trends in community pharmacy, including growing patient trust and increased demand for pharmacy care, as well as key opportunities to evolve and better support pharmacy teams.""

---

The first attached image from the report shows some statistics about how pharmacies are viewed in the community.

According to the survey, community pharmacies have high consumer trust and often are the most frequent ways that patients access healthcare.

Even if digital communication options are available, the majority of consumers prefer talking to pharmacy staff in person. Digital options seem to be best used as a supplement, not the foundation of patient interaction, according to the survey.

---

The second attached image illustrates that pharmacists and patients are ready for more healthcare inside the local #pharmacy.

This and other surveys have consistently shown pharmacists are able and willing to perform more healthcare services than they currently are, but it isn’t clear in the report if consumers want their pharmacist to perform more healthcare services or if they want the convenience of having more healthcare services available at their local pharmacy.

Specifically mentioned by consumers were a desire to have services in their local pharmacy like:

-Diagnostic tests for flu, strep throat, HIV, etc.
-Monitoring services like blood pressure testing (I would personally add A1C, blood glucose, and cholesterol testing)
-Vaccinations
-Pharmacists prescribing limited medications (e.g., birth control, naloxone, Paxlovid)

Community pharmacies are valuable access points for #PublicHealth

Many people value their community pharmacy and there seems to be demand to have the pharmacy offer more services beyond just filling prescriptions.","['Healthcare Provider', 'Payers and Insurers', 'Pharmaceutical Representative', 'Regulator']"

The study was published today in Scientific Reports and adds to the understand of the usefulness of Paxlovid in the Omicron-variant period.
Using electronic health records from the Dubai Health Authority (DHA) hospitals and clinics in the United Arab Emirates, the authors of the study compared outcomes of patients who received Paxlovid to those who did not receive any antiviral treatment for COVID-19 seen from May 22, 2022, to April 30, 2023, at any DHA-affiliated hospitals and clinics.
The study defined long COVID as continuous or new symptoms present 28 days or more following acute COVID-19 infection, based on physician notes. 
In total 7,290 non-hospitalized adult COVID-19 visits, including 672 patients who received Paxlovid and 6,618 patients who received no antiviral treatment, were included in the study. Almost half of the patients in both groups had received two doses of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (45% in the Paxlovid group, and 48% in the no-treatment group), the authors said.
1.1% in Paxlovid group hospitalized 
A total of 170 (2.3%) COVID-19-related hospitalizations lasting more than 1 day were observed over a 28-day period. These included 8 (1.1%) in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group and 162 (2.4%) in the no-treatment group.
After adjusting for factors, Paxlovid was associated with a 61% lower risk of hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.85). 
During a 90-day follow up, 208 patients (2.8%) experienced long-COVID symptoms that prompted them to see a physician. Paxlovid was associated with a 58% reduced risk of developing such symptoms during that period (aHR. 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.95).","['Healthcare Provider', 'Regulator', 'Pharmaceutical Representative']"

   The United Nations is an international organization founded in 1945 after the second world war by 51 countries committed to maintain international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights. 

  There are various healthcare system within the United Nations which includes World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Funds( UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Joint United Nation Programme on HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).


    If given the opportunity, l would love to work with the World Health Organization. Setting up a standard healthcare system for patients has always been my dream, the smile and satisfaction from a patient is what gives me joy.
  

   Since the foundation of WHO in 1948, the world has experienced countless public health challenges threatening our health and well-being. However, numerous obstacles have been overcomed and remarkable advancement have been made in medical science, health care and overall population health.



   The United Nations since its inception, has been actively involved in promoting health worldwide. At the outset, it was decided that WHO's top priorities would be malaria, women's and children's health, tuberculosis, venereal disease, nutrition and environmental pollution. Many of these remain on WHO's agenda today, in addition to relatively new disease like HIV/AIDS, Diabetes, Cancer, SARS( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), Ebola an Zika disease.



   During the COVID-19 outbreak, the WHO together with the FDA( Food and Drug Administration) established programs allowing clinicians to gain access to investigational therapies during the pandemic. Antiviral drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, baricitinib, monoclonal antibodies, paxlovid was approved by the FDA in treating COVID-19.

Advocates often provide support to patients grappling with Long Covid/Post-acute Sequelae of Covid (PASC) symptoms including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations and brain fog - recent flurry of studies and articles shed light on efforts to prevent and treat PASC:
·      Journal of Infection 2024 Jiang J, et al – summary of observational studies suggests that early nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) during acute Covid may reduce the risk of PASC although definitive evidence (from randomized controlled trial) is not available. Fortunately, the risk of PASC (without anti-viral medication) has declined from 10% early in the pandemic to current 3.5%. However, the stakes remain high as those afflicted by PASC often have an unrelenting course. 
·      JAMA Int Med 2024 Geng LN, et al – in patients with PASC, a 15-day course of Paxlovid disappointedly did not reduce symptoms.
·      At present, there’s neither cure nor validated treatment of PASC yet many practitioners view this malady as similar to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and base their treatments of PASC upon what seems to work in patients with CFS/ME. https://lnkd.in/eThJsiaY    
·      Regarding the cause of PASC - a highly sensitive test finds that approximately one-half of patients with PASC have residual virus hidden away long after their acute illness has resolved - https://lnkd.in/eCArTgx7 
·      Yet, another study – Annals Int Med 2024 Montaz-Rath M et al concluded that patients with PASC cannot be identified by routine blood testing (e.g. blood counts, chemistries).
Take home points:
·      Vaccination remains key preventive measure
·      Patients with acute Covid should consult with their primary care provider to individualize their risk of developing PASC and whether or not to proceed with Paxlovid in an effort to reduce this risk.
·      At present, there’s neither definitive cure nor treatment of PASC however many clinicians are drawing from what’s known about caring for patients with CFS/ME to mitigate PASC-related debility – management of patients with PASC involves both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and is tailored according to symptoms. 
·      A leading theory regarding the cause of PASC is that some patients, following recovery from an acute Covid illness, may have lingering virus which activates the immune system and this inflammation may lead to multi-organ dysfunction. 
·      Paxlovid has not been shown to effectively treat PASC yet ongoing research may identify sub-groups of patients with PASC who would benefit from a longer course of Paxlovid. 
·      However, if harboring the Covid virus is the cause of PASC in certain patients, what’s causing PASC in those without residual virus?",['Healthcare Provider']

While most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and recover at home, some people require medical care and treatment. Treatments for COVID-19 should always be prescribed by a doctor. If you have COVID-19 symptoms, contact a doctor right away and do not delay treatment. 
In addition to COVID-19 treatments, a doctor may recommend the following to relieve symptoms: 

• Medications to reduce fever (such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen) 

• Drinking water to stay hydrated 

• Getting plenty of rest to help your body fight off the virus 

Talk to a doctor to see which COVID-19 treatment or medication may be right for you. They can help determine if you are eligible.

Test to Treat program
Department of Health Services (DHS) is partnering with the federal government on a new Test to Treat program as part of the National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan. Through this program, people have access to “one-stop” test and treat locations. Select pharmacies and federally qualified health centers will provide rapid COVID-19 testing. If the person is qualified for treatment, a doctor will offer the medication on the spot. See Test to Treat locations.
Oral antiviral drugs authorized for treatment of COVID-19 

If you have symptoms of COVID-19, oral antiviral pills can help prevent severe illness. In December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized two oral antiviral medications for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms who are risk for severe illness: 

• Paxlovid 

• Lagevrio (also called molnupiravir) 

These medications stop the virus from replicating in your body which reduces your risk of severe COVID-19 illness, hospitalization, or death. These medications are limited to people who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. Both Paxlovid and Lagevrio must be started within the first five days of symptom onset.
A third antiviral treatment called Remdesivir is FDA approved for people diagnosed with COVID-19. This is an intravenous treatment that is available at some health care facilities. This medication is not distributed by the federal government, and we do not track its availability on our maps.
Lagevrio(molnupiravir)
Lagevrio is an oral antiviral medicine that can be used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
Paxlovid
Paxlovid is an oral antiviral medicine that can be used to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms.

(Printed in New York Times: Oct. 13, 2024)


After I spent more than 50 years chasing and fighting viruses, one fought back and nearly took me down. I speak of the West Nile virus, delivered by the deadliest animal on the planet: the mosquito.

I got infected not during any of my international trips over the years but most likely while I was outside my home in Washington, D.C. In mid-August I was feeling weak and exhausted but attributed it to a recent bout with Covid-19. Though I tested positive for Covid over a month prior, I experienced a rebound of symptoms after taking the treatment Paxlovid. Perhaps I was still experiencing lingering symptoms that would eventually resolve.

Not so. Instead, I began to experience unexplained severe fatigue and exhaustion, culminating in my admission to a hospital on Aug. 16, delirious and incoherent, with a temperature of 103 degrees. I remember little of the five and a half days that I spent in the hospital, except that I had never felt so ill in my life. My physicians assumed that I had sepsis and treated me with antibiotics. That changed the next day when blood tests revealed that I had West Nile virus.

There is no treatment for West Nile virus disease, and I was left to deal with its toll on my body. It was terrifying....
Fortunately, over a few weeks, slow improvement began. I. I am on my way to a total recovery, but it has been a harrowing experience.",['Pharmaceutical Representative']

Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor initially developed for HIV treatment that is now used as a pharmacokinetic booster for other antiretrovirals due to it being a cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme and P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Consequently, ritonavir is of special interest for repurposing in other diseases. It had an important role in battling the COVID-19 pandemic as a part of the developed drug Paxlovid® in association with nirmatrelvir and has shown effects in hepatitis and other pathogenic diseases. Ritonavir has also shown promising results in overcoming drug resistance and enhancing the efficacy of existing chemotherapeutic agents in oncology. Evidence of cancer repurposing potential was demonstrated in cancers such as ovarian, prostate, lung, myeloma, breast, and bladder cancer, with several mechanisms of action presented. In vitro studies indicate that ritonavir alone can inhibit key pathways involved in cancer cell survival and proliferation, causing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and metabolic stress due to the inhibition of molecules like heat shock protein 90 and cyclin-dependent kinases. Ritonavir also causes resistant cells to become sensitized to anticancer drugs like gemcitabine or docetaxel. These findings indicate that repurposing ritonavir, either on its own or in combination with other medications, could be a promising approach for treating various diseases. This is particularly relevant in cancer therapy, where ritonavir repurposing is the central focus of this review.",['Healthcare Provider']

That at least 232,000 deaths could have been prevented among unvaccinated adults during the 15 months had they been vaccinated with at least a primary series.
None of this bothered pro-infection doctors. In his article Pubic Health Should Lose Your Trust, Dr. Vinay Prasad excoriated public health officials not because they failed to blunt COVID’s impact, but rather because they tried to hard to do so. He wrote:
Trust is justified based on how an organization or system performs. And the truth is, the entire public health apparatus, failed. In addition to that, leaders at FDA and NIH and CDC engaged in lies and propaganda. As such, they should lose your trust, and without serious reforms you should not return the trust of these organizations.
Those are harsh words. Dr. Prasad listed several reasons why not to trust public heath and none of them had to do with those 1.2 million deaths. His reasons were: natural immunity counts for nothing, masking efficacy, vaccine-myocarditis, Paxlovid, and one size fits all booster recs. All of these measures were intended to limit COVID’s damage, and whatever their flaws, none of them are as bad as dying of COVID. Yet these are the only things that concerned Dr. Prasad.""

I don’t usually write out what I’m going to say in advance, but this time I had some things I needed to express. So here they are, and may 5785 be a year of renewal and healing.
*******************************************
Good evening, everyone. Thank you for being here, and thank you to all who made public comments. It’s been a tough week in my family, as my elderly parents in San Diego both got COVID for the first time even after getting the new vaccine, which thankfully made it more mild. Neither was hospitalized, but it’s been difficult. So I encourage everyone again to get the new COVID vaccine and to wear a mask in public if you are immunocompromised, and if you get COVID to ask your doctor about paxlovid, which also reduces severity.

To take an even more serious note, this is the time of year when Jewish people look back, because our new year starts tomorrow night, with Rosh Hashanah. And normally I would just say happy new year, but this year, I am finding it incredibly difficult to grapple with. It is not for local officials to speak on foreign affairs, but I must - and here I have to say that I speak for myself only.

One year ago, after October 7th. I was not ok. In the following weeks, the support from everyone here in Fullerton sustained me. Attending a vigil at Temple Beth Tikvah with Mayor Dunlap, Councilmember Whitaker, and Councilmember Zahra was incredibly healing. I remember in particular having honest and meaningful conversations with Councilmember Zahra, and the peace that both of us felt in standing in unity here at home against any forms of violence. We held a peaceful candlelight vigil at CSUF, with both the Muslim Dumas and Jewish Kaddish prayers, and it was attended by the entire community, including both Chief Radus and Chief Frisbee, which helped us all feel supported and safe. Seeing the billboards in Fullerton made me proud of my community. 

But today’s news of spreading violence…this is worst possible way to start the year 5785. While everyone has the right to speak freely, I hope that as the anniversary of 10/7 approaches, people will use their voices to condemn violence in any form.

I’m going to end with something I wrote years ago, in a quieter time in the world, when I had just reconnected with being Jewish. I was just about to travel to Jerusalem for the first time in my life. And I wrote it about the word “Shalom.” It’s called Complete.

Complete 
We're told as children that Shalom means Peace or a way to say Hello. Goodbye. But I learned here, in my home, in my community, that instead Shalom means Complete. Shalom means Wholeness and Fulfillment. Shalom means Peace flowing, because we have found Shalom here, in our homes and our communities with each other, our spiritual sisters and brothers.

May our search for Completeness and Wholeness be fulfilled for us all in this new year.

Thank you.","['Healthcare Provider', 'Regulator']"

After some personal and business travel, I returned home and tested positive for Covid. While my respiratory symptoms were mild and improved with Paxlovid, I soon faced intense stomach discomfort. As things escalated, I found myself in the ER. Initial tests raised concerns, and within hours, I was in surgery, undergoing a procedure that resulted in the removal of over a meter of my small intestine.

Recovery was a gradual process, as I had to reintroduce both liquids and solid foods and regain my physical strength. Throughout this time, I shared my experience with family and friends, whose support was nothing short of incredible.

Thanks to the amazing community around me, we raised over $10,000 for the Walk to End Lupus Now in Los Angeles! Right after my surgery, I was uncertain if I could participate, but this past Saturday, I proudly joined Team Ungstoppable at the opening ceremony and was able to complete the walk!

I’m taking my recovery one day at a time and feel grateful for my support system during these challenging moments. I'm also thankful I sought medical attention when I did, and I encourage everyone to prioritize their mental, physical, and emotional health. Remember, you know your body best!

NOTE: it’s not COVID it’s COVID-19 that is the proper terminology. There are many other unrelated COVID diseases. 
I would like to go on record, that our government’s, provincial and in particular the Federal Government completely disregarding the safety and health of Canadian elder citizens, e.g. those over 65, which can become severely impacted by being infected and developing COVID-19 disease. It is well established that the most vulnerable segment of our society to the severe impact of COVID-19 are the elderly. As a Canadian over 70 years old, I believe we need to sue the Government for criminal negligence by not providing the COVID-19 test. Example: My wife went to BC a few months ago to a medical conference. She came home and was asymptomatic for the infection. Two days after her arrival she tested positive for infection. The the following day I test positive for the infection. Since we don’t have a family physician as he retired at the beginning of the pandemic I had to convince our pharmacist to provide us Paxlovid, the leading effective medication for treating this infection during the first five days. As a result we both recovered and did not develop the cytokine storm which typically is the point where a patient develops severe respiratory symptoms and as is well known most elders will suffer and die during the second week of the ""Disease Covid-19"". I believe the Canadian government is demonstrating lack of respect nor care concerning our elder citizens and a class action law suite should be considered - CJL); Jennifer Yoon · CBC News · Posted: Sep 29, 2024","['Healthcare Provider', 'Regulator']"

Recent findings from Weill Cornell Medicine, the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, and the National Institutes of Health highlight a crucial development in our battle against COVID-19. Their study, published in Nature Communications, reveals that immunocompromised individuals can harbor and potentially spread antiviral-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2.

🔬 Study Insights: 
◾ Certain immunocompromised patients treated with antivirals like Paxlovid and remdesivir developed resistant strains of the virus, continuing to shed these variants for months. 
◾ One identified variant showed resistance to both Paxlovid and remdesivir, raising concerns about the transmission of these resistant strains to the broader population.

🌟 Implications: This study underscores the need for tailored treatment strategies for immunocompromised patients to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant COVID-19 variants. It also stresses the importance of continuous surveillance and possibly combining therapies to combat these challenges effectively.

I recently spoke with a former healthcare executive who tested positive for COVID, and his experience highlights some systemic issues we need to address:

1. *Misinformation*: Despite being on blood thinners, he was advised to take Paxlovid without further questions. While some on blood thinners have taken Paxlovid safely, it could have caused harm. Shouldn’t health systems ask the right questions?

2. *Access to Treatment*: A major health system in Boston didn’t have Remdesivir and refused to refer him elsewhere, even though another hospital had it. He made a few calls and got what he needed. But what about those without such connections?

3. *Logistical Failures*: At a new hospital, they initially told him he could only get two infusions because the third fell on a Saturday. Thankfully, it was resolved, but what if two infusions weren’t enough?

The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets, making it highly contagious, and can cause severe respiratory illness and complications, particularly in vulnerable populations. By 2020, many countries faced overwhelming health systems, lockdowns, and widespread economic disruptions as they worked to contain the spread.

Efforts to curb COVID-19 have evolved significantly since the pandemic’s early stages. Key strategies include:

Vaccination: The rapid development and global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines have been one of the most significant tools in curbing the pandemic. Vaccines from manufacturers like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson have proven effective in reducing severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths.
Testing and Diagnostics: Increased testing capacity allowed for early detection and isolation of cases, preventing further transmission. At-home tests and rapid antigen tests helped people identify infections more easily.
Public Health Measures: Initially, social distancing, mask-wearing, quarantine, and travel restrictions were key measures to reduce transmission. These were widely adopted globally, though policies varied by region.

Treatment Advances: Over time, medical treatments for COVID-19 improved. Antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, and corticosteroids, like dexamethasone, have been used to treat severe cases. In addition, antibody therapies became available, helping reduce mortality and recovery time.

Global Coordination: Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and initiatives like COVAX played important roles in coordinating responses, distributing vaccines to low-income countries, and monitoring virus mutations.

Public Awareness: Information campaigns and education have helped the public adopt preventive measures and make informed health decisions.
Despite these efforts, the virus continues to circulate and mutate, creating variants that sometimes evade immunity from previous infections or vaccinations. As a result, many countries are focusing on long-term management rather than elimination, treating COVID-19 as an endemic disease. Regular vaccinations, enhanced public health surveillance, and healthcare preparedness are key to managing it moving forward.",['Regulator']

Any drug prescribed or self- medicated medicine can expose the patient to the risk of mild (minor) or serious adverse drug reactions. It is the fact that, drug safety an area where there is notorious risk and uncertainty.  Post marketing surveillance or pharmacovigilance helps prevent, manages, and monitor adverse drug reactions. This can be practiced at health facilities, individually through clinical practice involving patients and prescriber.
From the above theory, adverse drug reactions can be classified as #white, #grey, or #black swans.
#White_Swans: are well-described and known adverse drug reactions 
Psychiatric effects of hydroxychloroquine (during the COVID-19 pandemic lock down
#Black_Swan: Unpredictable effects (event) have a major impact on patients and populations, yet come as a surprise because we have not been able to calculate the probability of these rare adverse reactions using clinical drug evaluations or data from clinical trials.
 Example: the risk of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia from non-replicating adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccines. 
#Grey_Swan: are unexpected because they were not reported in clinical trials, but thanks to pharmacovigilance it would be detected from pharmacological knowledge (pharmacodynamics of the drug effects, drug mechanism of action, history of drugs, pharmacokinetics, and pharmaco-genetics) and would help predict and prioritise potential pharmacovigilance signals 
Example of remdesivir (when marketed and used for COVID-19) and serious bradycardia 
Therefore, Pharmacovigiliance systems should be able to handle detect the “black swan” events which have major impact on public health and patients.

It is very truly present and is continuously causing problems for people of all ages, but more for those who are frail and older.

The Journal of American Medical Association provided an excellent overview of its management that continues to focus around prevention via vaccinations and then treatment with antivirals.

Here are a few highlights:

- Adults 65 years and older continue to experience the highest rates of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19, emphasizing the need for therapeutic interventions in this population.
- Increasing the use of COVID-19 treatments to 80% could reduce hospitalizations by 42% and deaths by 51%, yet only 16.5% of high-risk adults have ever received treatment.
-Antiviral therapy should be initiated within 5-7 days of symptom onset in high-risk individuals, especially those aged 65 and older or with comorbidities such as heart disease or diabetes.
- Three antiviral treatments are suggested—nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), remdesivir, and molnupiravir. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and remdesivir have the highest efficacy in reducing severe outcomes.
- Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir interacts with several medications via the CYP3A enzyme, so clinicians should use databases to assess interactions.
- Although rebound of symptoms after antiviral treatment is possible, it has not been linked to severe disease, hospitalization, or antiviral resistance.

In an industry-shaking move, AstraZeneca, the UK’s largest drugmaker valued at $140 billion, has reportedly approached Gilead Sciences, an American biopharmaceutical company valued at $96 billion, to explore a possible merger. While the approach was informal, it aimed to gauge Gilead's interest in what could become the largest pharmaceutical merger in history. If successful, the merger would surpass notable deals, such as the $87.6 billion merger between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene Corporation.

This potential merger is likely motivated by the global race to develop Covid-19 treatments. Gilead’s antiviral drug Remdesivir, proven to shorten recovery time for Covid-19 patients, could generate $7 billion in annual sales by 2022 if stockpiling strategies are adopted. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca is advancing in its development of a potential Covid-19 vaccine. Combining their efforts could cement their dominance in coronavirus treatment.

However, the merger is far from certain. Gilead, a profitable and stable company, has historically shied away from large-scale mergers, favoring smaller acquisitions. With a strong financial standing, the likelihood of Gilead agreeing to a deal remains speculative.

Though difficult to achieve, a successful merger could reshape the pharmaceutical industry and create a global leader in healthcare innovation.

Recent findings from Weill Cornell Medicine, the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, and the National Institutes of Health highlight a crucial development in our battle against COVID-19. Their study, published in Nature Communications, reveals that immunocompromised individuals can harbor and potentially spread antiviral-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2.

🔬 Study Insights: 
◾ Certain immunocompromised patients treated with antivirals like Paxlovid and remdesivir developed resistant strains of the virus, continuing to shed these variants for months. 
◾ One identified variant showed resistance to both Paxlovid and remdesivir, raising concerns about the transmission of these resistant strains to the broader population.

🌟 Implications: This study underscores the need for tailored treatment strategies for immunocompromised patients to prevent the emergence and spread of resistant COVID-19 variants. It also stresses the importance of continuous surveillance and possibly combining therapies to combat these challenges effectively.

In 2024, there have been significant drug recalls related to #rarediseases. A notable recall involved Veklury (remdesivir), an antiviral drug used primarily to treat COVID-19. 

Gilead Sciences issued a recall in September due to the presence of glass particles in a specific batch of the injectable form. This defect could potentially lead to serious health risks such as vessel blockage and stroke if administered .

Additionally, while there haven’t been recalls directly tied to rare diseases beyond this, important developments include the approval of Aqneursa (levacetylleucine) and Miplyffa (arimoclomol) for Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC).

While the world was fighting the COVID-19 infection, Gilead Sciences produced and marketed an injection- Remdesivir to treat hospitalized and non-hospitalized adults and children suffering from the COVID-19 infection. 
In September 2022, two Remdesivir lawsuits were filed, but what led to the filing of lawsuits, was it the manufacturer's or the physician's fault? If you’re new to this case, you may have your doubts. Let me brief it: 

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠? Clinical trials and studies found that Remdesvir did not play any role in curing the infection. Moreover, they found that the injection could lead to acute kidney damage, heart failure, increased liver enzymes, and can be fatal. 

𝐃𝐢𝐝 𝐢𝐭 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐬𝐞? Well, yes. It was found that the patients were not informed or asked for consent before administering the injection. Many people alleged that Gilead made the hospitals prescribe this drug to their patients. 

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐦𝐚𝐝𝐞? 
➡ The doctors committed fraud by prescribing the drug to the victims without their knowledge. 
➡ They also failed to explain that the drug is ineffective in treating COVID-19 infection, can be toxic to the kidneys, and can cause death. 

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐧𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐱𝐭? A class action lawsuit has been filed against Gilead Sciences, alleging negligence, violation of consumer protection laws, fraud, and strict liability.  

Since it is an ongoing case and there are possibilities of many more lawsuits coming up, I’m curious to know where this case heads. Surely, medical records are going to play a critical role in these cases.

—Oxygen, given through nasal prongs or a mask
—Intravenous (IV) fluids to keep you well hydrated
—Steroids, if you have underlying lung conditions
—Antiviral medications, like remdesivir
—Biologic medications, like vilobelimab or tocilizumab
—Anti-inflammatory medications, like baricitinib or anakinra

When you go to the ER for COVID, one of the most important parts of your evaluation will be checking your vital signs. These include your: 

—Oxygen level (sometimes called “pulse ox”)
—Breathing rate
—Heart rate
—Blood pressure

Depending on your vital signs and physical exam, your care team may also run some additional tests to see how the virus is affecting your body. These tests may include:

—X-ray of your lungs to look for signs of pneumonia or fluid
—CT scan of your chest to look at the lungs in greater detail or to check for blood clots
—Electrocardiogram (ECG) of your heart to look for signs of stress or strain on your heart
—Blood tests to check your blood counts, kidney function, and electrolytes

After these tests, you’ll discuss if you’re safe to continue recovering at home or if you should stay in the hospital for closer monitoring.

What happens when you are admitted to the hospital?

Your care team in the ER will probably recommend you stay in the hospital if:

—You’re struggling to breathe.
—Your oxygen levels are low.
—You’re struggling to stay hydrated or keep fluids down.
—You have any changes in how alert or sleepy you are, or how coherent you seem.
—You have a medical condition that makes it more likely that your infection will worsen.

If this bill passes, A1884 will deem the act of disseminating “misinformation” as professional misconduct for health care professionals and further subject them to disciplinary action. This bill defines “disseminate” to mean the conveyance of information, in the form of treatment or advice, from a health care professional to a patient under the health care professional’s care. “Misinformation” is defined as: “any health-related claim of fact that is false and contradicted by contemporary scientific consensus contrary to the standard of care.” “Disinformation” is defined as:  “misinformation that is deliberately disseminated with malicious intent or an intent to mislead.”
Key Questions Raised: 
Are New Jersey legislators attempting to silence healthcare professionals and infringe upon free speech? 
Will this bill transform New Jersey into a medical police state, where dissenting medical opinions are punished rather than discussed and further studied? 
Haven’t we learned from the mistakes of the COVID-19 pandemic in that some of the interventions and treatments recommended based on consensus from the medical community turned out to have devastating consequences for patients (ie: intubation and Remdesivir)?
Doesn’t this bill contradict the fluid and evolving nature of the scientific method? 
How will this bill affect medical professionals' use of new treatments or those being used successfully “off-label”?
Will this bill prevent medical professionals from thinking ‘outside the box’ when dealing with difficult-to-treat and rare diseases/illnesses?
Will chiropractors, acupuncturists, mental healthcare professionals, social workers be targeted by this bill as well? Will this restrict social workers in sessions with patients' and their ability to speak freely and have open discussions on various topics? This seems like a very slippery slope.
Will practitioners be restricted to only practicing medicine if it is based on “contemporary scientific consensus or following the standard of care?” 
Why would a patient need a second opinion if healthcare professionals would only be able to practice the “contemporary scientific consensus?”
Will pharmaceutical representatives’ conversations/content also be scrutinized for misinformation/disinformation?
If this bill passes, how will this “misinformation/disinformation” be enforced? Will healthcare professionals be reported or disciplined for offering advice outside “scientific consensus?” 
Who will determine what is considered outside the “scientific consensus”?
Could this bill stifle scientific progress in New Jersey, as it might have prevented questioning about outdated practices like lobotomies?","['Healthcare Provider', 'Regulator']"

No, not at all.

It's happening as we speak.

The Amoxicillins, the Azithromycins, the Fluconazoles, the Levofloxacins. Even the highly selective Linezolid usually reserved for severe infections and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

This can also be seen in other parts of the world.

Take for example antimalarial Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACT) treatments in Africa.

Having lived in West Africa for some time, I remember how people so easily popped an antimalarial at the first signs of flu/ fever like symptoms, least bothered to have a Doctors opinion.

ACTs were OTCs!

On the other side of the spectrum, I have another example. 

Last year I was in Barcelona for CPHI, and had been carrying along a 10 day pretty rough chest infection.

Forgetting for a minute I was in Europe, I popped into one of their beautiful pharmacies and asked for 3 tablets of Azithromycin 500mg.

They all looked at me as if I'd asked for their kidneys.

They immediately asked for the prescription.

In whatever Spanish I knew, I simply had to explain I didn't have one. 

And as per their rules, they refused to serve me - however much I tried to prove my chesty cough to their on-duty manager.

Funnily, I truly felt the respect given to what a prescription drug stands for and how it is dispensed to patients.

Yes, over there, Rx medications are certainly not commercialised as OTCs.

Back to AMRs seen in India.

What do you think are some of the causes?

I can think of a few.

💊 Pharma companies can get really pushy for sales. Imagine branding a double antibiotic FDC simply as an 'antidiarrheal drug'! And please do note that diarrhea has other causes other than bacteria.

👨‍⚕️ The pressure on medical reps to achieve the ludicrous targets easily leads to unethical promotion onto Doctors, in many cases leading to unnecessary prescription and eventually over-consumption of antibiotics.

🏥 Hospitals are big businesses in India and we all know how patient can get so easily squeezed financially once they get caught, sorry, admitted. Just imagine how much Remdesivir was administered during Covid and at what cost.

🩺  Prescribing habits of DRs should remain ethical and patient centric. Prescribing antibiotics to satisfy MRs and pharma companies is totally unacceptable in the current context.

⚕️ Patients asking for and chemists dispensing antibiotics without prescriptions NEEDS to end. 

Now surely, there are many other causes to AMRs.

But the above few are quite critical and we humans, or human greed if you prefer, is responsible.

This is something that can be curbed.

If not eradicated.

Hard-core stringent legislation is what's missing.

Severity of repurcusions and punishments follows in a close second.

Rules need to be set.

Rules need to be followed.

With ethics and discipline. 

A bit like in Barcelona I guess.

Time to time she looks up my old author profiles and shares with me my stories she thinks were well-written, relevant or important interviews. She sent me this story back from the time when there was an acute shortage of #Remdesivir. Asked me, “why did you not tell me that you’d written this story.” I told her that honestly I didn’t even remember this existed. She was clearly shocked and asked again—how can I forget about an important interview. I told her, I only remember the circumstances.

The point is, as writers, journalists, or content creators, we often get so consumed by the process, the pressure that we lose sight of the impact of our work. We may forget the stories, but it’s the situations we document—crisis moments, human challenges, experiences that last. This conversation with Maa was a humbling reminder that the written word lives on even when we’re not looking.
